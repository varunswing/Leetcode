Java 8

1.	The appletviewer tool is available in Java 8.	                
2.	Java 8 has the AWTUtilities class, which we didn't recommend you to use because it can break any program depending on it.    
3.	It has fewer string methods.	                                
4.	No special variables are used for lambda parameters.	        
5.	Java Deployment Technologies are available in Java 8.	        
6.	JMC and JavaFX are available in the Oracle JDK.	                
7.	There are no suitable methods to work with the file.	        
8.	Pattern recognizing is not possible.	          
              

Java 11

1.  The appletviewer tool is not available in Java 11.
2.  In Java 11, the AWTUtilities class is not available.
3.  Several new methods of String such as isBlank(), lines(),repeat(n), stripLeading(), stripTrailing(), and strip() are introduce.
4.  Java 11 allows us to use var variables to be used in lambda expressions.
5.  Java Deployment Technologies are removed in Java 11.
6.  JMC and JavaFX are removed from the Oracle JDK in Java 11.
7.  In Java 11, there are various methods, such as writeString(), readString(), and isSameFile() which help us to perform several operations on file.
8.  Pattern recognizing is possible with the help of the asMatchPredicate() method.
